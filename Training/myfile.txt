Project
“Title: Location Variation Control in Steering Column Assembly by Jig Improvement.
          Our Project work is done in Hyundai Mobis Private India limited.
Description: we designed a new jig for the steering column, In old jig it looks with various drawbacks in its
designs such as ignition lock issue, shaking condition, clamp deflection, column pipe damage, movement of
steering column, lack of supporting clamp, defect in motor supporting stage and attachment for steering column
etc., In order to overcome all those drawbacks, we all came up with an idea in concluding all these problems. It
provided a rigid and clamping type jig to avoid ignition lock gap issue.

Project2:     Automatic car lifting jack
DESCRIPTION: 
                   The automatic car jack basically works on the conservation of the motion .The automatic 
car jack converts the rotary motion into the translatory motion. The automatic car jack is operated by 
turning the lead screw with the motor and chain & gear mechanism which eliminates the requirement 
of the human labor to rotate the lead screw. The motor is driven by the 12V battery which is generally 
the battery of car itself.

fine aggregate on the strength properties. Copper slag is the
waste material of matte smelting and refining of copper such
that each ton of copper generates approximately 2.5 tons of
copper  slag.  Copper  slag  is  one  of  the  materials  that  is
considered as a waste which could have a promising future in
construction Industry as partial or full substitute of aggregates.
For this research work, M25 grade concrete was used and tests
were  conducted  for  various  proportions  of  copper  slag
replacement with sand of 0 to 100% in concrete. The obtained
results were compared with those of control concrete made with
ordinary Portland cement and sand.

ACADEMIC PROJECT
PARTIAL  REPLACE  OF  FINE  AGGREGATE  IN
CONCRETE MIX DESIGN
Description: This paper reports on an experimental program to
investigate the effect of using copper slag as a replacement of
fine aggregate on the strength properties. Copper slag is the
waste material of matte smelting and refining of copper such
that each ton of copper generates approximately 2.5 tons of
copper  slag.  Copper  slag  is  one  of  the  materials  that  is
considered as a waste which could have a promising future in
construction Industry as partial or full substitute of aggregates.
For this research work, M25 grade concrete was used and tests
were  conducted  for  various  proportions  of  copper  slag
replacement with sand of 0 to 100% in concrete. The obtained
results were compared with those of control concrete made with
ordinary Portland cement and sand.

breakers”

The mechanism consists of a vertical piston spring arrangement,
which impinges pressurized fluid on the prime mover, and this
rotates the shaft connected to the motor to generate electrical
energy.

The assembly was designed on Solid Works and later fabricated
using select materials.

Tests were conducted to measure the rpm of the shaft and the
voltage generated. By determining the input mechanical energy
and the output electrical energy, the efficiency was calculated.

         A brief study on the project Auto spark advance by comparing the results of advance spark and how we can 
increase the efficiency of auto vehicles by using the spark advance technology. In our project we also done the work
on the electronic ignition system and spark advance timing control with the help of the centrifugal advance and 
vacume advance. 
         A one month training in the govt. sugar mills puranpur pilibhit in this time duration we study about the process
of sugar production from sugarcane. In this duration we also gain some practical knowledge about the electrical 
generation plant and also study about the boilers turbines condensers and their specifications.

PROJECTS UNDERTAKEN:
Name of the Project: 
MEMORY DESIGNING
Duration: 
3 months 
Language/ Platform/ Databases Used:   VHDL (ModelSim SE6.2b)
MEMORY DESIGNING includes designing of static ram with VHDL programming. SRAM 
exists primarily as general purpose products and integrated chips. The objective of this 
project is to present SRAM in general purpose parallel programming language.
Name of the Project: 
WIRELESS ROBOT WITH FIRE ALARM
Duration: 
3 months 
Language/ Platform/ Databases Used:   4Vision(C Programming)
In my project I built a robot handled wirelessly with RF frequency of 433 MHz of 
Transmitter and Receiver. The robot consists of a camera which records audio visuals 
wirelessly in real-time scenario. It also consists of a fire alarm which buzzes if it detects any 
fire around which is also known as temperature sensor. This robot has great use in various 
industries where things are turning micro. Areas where human contact cannot be made this 
robot can be sent in substitute. It has its applications in water by making it an aqua robot and 
other myriad applications in many other fields of work.
